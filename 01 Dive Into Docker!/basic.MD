### Docker Ecosystem 
Docker client + Docker Server + Docker Machine + Docker Images + Docker Hub + Docker Compose <br/>
**Docker CLient** - Docker client means Docker CLI, when we write any docker command then docker cli picks that command and transfer that to docker server. <br/>
**Docker server** - Docker server means where all docker releated work happens.
### Docker in windows and mac -

**One question may arise that if docker shares it image's operationg system with linux then how docker runs on windows and mac?** <br/>
While we install docker on windows or mac then by default docker installs a linux virtual machines on windows or mac os system. then docker runs on that linux vurtual machine.
and shares image's and container's operating system with that linux virtual machine. <br/>
